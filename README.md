In this project, I applied Linear Regression to predict mobile phone prices using the dataset: Mobile-Price-Prediction-cleaned_data.csv. The goal was to analyze the relationships between different features and the target variable (Price).

I performed the following steps:
Cleaned and analyzed the dataset, checking for null values and resetting indices.
Selected features like RAM, ROM, Mobile_Size, and Battery_Power as predictors.
Trained another Linear Regression model and made predictions.
Evaluated the model's accuracy using RMSE and R² score.

By applying data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques, I successfully predicted the target variables and demonstrated the application of regression models in real-world datasets. ​
